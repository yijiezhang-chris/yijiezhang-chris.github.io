* B.E. in Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, 2014-2018.

Research Experience
======
* 04/2019 - present: Graduate Research Student, UCLA
  * Implemented Image preprocessing such as image registration on several datasets
  * Designed a neural network for virtual multi staining, staining blending and capturing microstructures of staining tissues
  * Optimized the state-of-the-art system for virtual staining to get credible inference results for pathologist’s clinical diagnosis
  * Supervisor: [Yair Rivenson](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/yair-rivenson/) , [Adogan Ozcan](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/)

* 03/2018 - 05/2018: Undergraduate Research Student, Zhejiang University
  * Designed and simulated structure of the device by COMSOL
  * Fabricated the device, waveguide, platform and sources emitting different waves
  * Tested the device and documented the device’s performance in different fields
  * Supervisor: Fei Sun , [Sailing He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WFETHIUAAAAJ&hl=en)
  
* Summer 2017: Summer Research Student, University of Notre Dame
  * Designed structure of the optical tuning EBG circuit, and optimized it with HFSS
  * Built the optimized circuit and did some tests by VNA
