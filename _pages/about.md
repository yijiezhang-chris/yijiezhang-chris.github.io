BIBLIOGRAPHY
======
Hi, I am a second-year M.S. student in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am fortunate to work with [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) ([The Stanford Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/)) and [Vivek Kulkarni](https://viveksck.github.io/) ([Stanford NLP Lab](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/)). *I am actively applying for PhD programs in natural language processing, computational psycholinguistics, and computational social science for Fall 2020.*

My research focuses on studying language and cognition with machine learning. My goal for pursuing a Ph.D degree is to not only improve natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks but also make *machines achieve learning and reasoning capabilities closer to human learners*. My favorite quote is from [Andrew Ng](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ang/contact.html): *Artificial Intelligence is the New Electricity*. Therefore, I am also passionate about applying ML and NLP techniques in the field of education and sustainable development to make everyone benefit from AI technologies.

Overall, my research interest includes but not limited to:
*  Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Decision Making Under Uncertainty
*  Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics
*  Computational Social Science, Computational Cognitive Science
*  Language Variation and Change, Social Reasoning, Language Acquisition 
*  Machine Learning for Education and Sustainable Development

Prior to Stanford, I spent four years as an undergraduate in Computer Science and Linguistics at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I worked with [Jinho D. Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html) in [Emory NLP Lab](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/home.html) on natural language processing and [Roberto Franzosi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I5SYOqoAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Emory Program for Computer-Assisted Coding of Events (PC-ACE)](https://pc-ace.com/about/team/) on computational social science. 

I've also spent time at 
* Apple Inc. (working with [Bing Zhao](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bzhao/), [Vivek Kumar Rangarajan Sridhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VfezouUAAAAJ&hl=en))
* [Educational Testing Service (ETS)](https://www.ets.org/) (working with [Martin Chodorow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PuwfixYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Nitin Madnani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ow3PIFcAAAAJ), [Aoife Cahill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1a-TXfYAAAAJ))
* [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) (working with [Brian MacWhinney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V8EhIsIAAAAJ&hl=en))
