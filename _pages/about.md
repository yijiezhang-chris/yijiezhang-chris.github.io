BIBLIOGRAPHY
======
Hi, I am a second-year M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA, where I am fortunate to work in [Ozcan Lab](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/) and directed by Professor [Yair Rivenson](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/yair-rivenson/). I am also working on some computatioanl imaging projects personally with [Guangyuan Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKLSFzEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), who is a Ph.D. students advised by [Achuta Kadambi](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/index.htm). *I am actively applying for PhD programs in computational imaging, biomedical imaging, optics and machine learning for Fall 2020.*

Overall, my research interest includes but not limited to:
*  Computational Imaging
*  Biomedical Imaging
*  Machine Learning, Deep Learning
*  Computer Vision
*  Image Processing
*  Digital Pathology

Prior to UCLA, I spent four years as an undergraduate in Optical Science and Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), where I worked with Sailing He and Fei Sun on invisible cloak.

I've also spent time at 
* University of Notre Dame. (working with [Lei Liu](https://www3.nd.edu/~lliu3/) on terahertz circuit)
